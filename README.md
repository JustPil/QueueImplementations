# QueueImplementations
Summary

Implementations of Queue and Deque ADTs.

Design

Queue implementation uses ArrayList for internal storage of elements..
Deque implementations use internal storage options of Array, Linked List, and Circular Linked List.
Classic Queue methods such as enqueue and dequeue are supported. Deque allows for enqueue and dequeue at both front and rear. In the case of the Linked List implementations, swapping of nodes at the front and/or rear are supported.
